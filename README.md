# Afterpay Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Afterpay was founded in 2014 and formally incorporated in 2015 by two Australian entrepreneurs, Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen. Molnar was originally inspired to form Afterpay while he was a student in college in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which he claims changed customer behavior patterns towards, "a huge swing among Millennials toward spending money on debit cards, not credit cards." Afterpay was originally listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 2016 at the price of $1 USD per share, raising approximately $25 million USD in their original IPO lisitng. 

## Business Activities:

Afterpay was created after the recession of 2008, which Molnar believes scared many younger consumers into being more responsible with their finances and avoid the pitfalls that brought on the global recession.“Millennials are tech savvy, informed and conscious about not falling into debt. Trust is really important to them... They’re into budgeting and being responsible with their spending, but they also still want that instant gratification in retail.”
